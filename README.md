Here is the project of Arzu Yıldırım. There are 3 files here. The first is the R file, which contains preprocessing codes to make the Java dataset compatible with gephi. The second file is the R file containing the sentiment analysis codes. Finally, you can find the pdf file related to graphics and findings from these analyzes.
I have found dataset regarding network analysis from https://zenodo.org/record/1411479#.XshUABMzZ0v and received the twitter data under #theforceawakens hashtag by using an API key of my friend. I also added Twitter data file.
